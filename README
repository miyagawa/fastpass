NAME

DESCRIPTION
    Fastpass is a standalone FastCGI daemon that is designed to work out of
    the box with nginx HTTP server. The supported feature set is close to
    Unicorn <http://unicorn.bogomips.org/> and Starman i.e. preforking, TCP
    and UNIX domain socket support and PSGI compatible, but Fastpass works
    with the FastCGI protocol instead of HTTP.
